\begin{letter}{\textbf{Letter of Intent}}

\opening{Dear SIAM Board of Trustees,}

 We would like to initiate a SIAM student chapter at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. The main purpose of the chapter would be to promote computational mathematics and scientific computing among our undergraduate and graduate students and to get them involved doing research in these areas.

The chapter agenda will be in parallel with our already established Research in Scientific Computing in Undergraduate Education (RESCUE) program funded by National Science Foundation.

Sponsor and faculty advisors are listed as the following.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Sponsor} &: University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth \\
\textbf{Department} &: Department of Mathematics \\
\textbf{Faculty Advisor 1} &: Alfa R.H. Heryudono, Assistant Professor \\
&\ \ aheryudono@umassd.edu, 508-999-8516 (office) \\
\textbf{Faculty Advisor 2} &: Cheng Wang, Assistant Professor \\
&\ \ cwang1@umassd.edu, 508-999-8342 (office) \\
\end{tabular}

We plan to have monthly chapter meetings and events. Typical chapter activities would include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Setting up a UMass Dartmouth student chapter Web site.
\item Fun with \textsc{MATLAB} sessions.
\item Pizza, soda, and numerical PDEs with \textsc{MATLAB} (inspired by Oxford SC activity).
\item Do you \LaTeX ? (an introduction to technical writing with \LaTeX\ session).
\item Annual picnic + Bocce competition at one of Massachusetts local parks.
\newpage
\item Participate in student day and poster session at SIAM Annual Meeting.
\item Establish SIAM lounge to facilitate student interaction and collaboration.
\item Organize talks by students or faculty.
\item Sponsor lectures by guest speakers.
\end{enumerate}

We hope that you look favorably on this application and we look forward to starting a student chapter here at UMass Dartmouth. Thank you for your attention.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
