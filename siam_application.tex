\begin{letter}{\textbf{Letter of Intent}}

\opening{Dear SIAM Board of Trustees,}

We would like to initiate a SIAM student chapter at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands. The main purpose of the chapter would be to promote computational mathematics and scientific computing among our PhD and master students. The aim of establishing a student chapter will therefore be to improve the scientific and personal interaction between the students. This is in particular desirable in Delft because of a huge variety of nationalities among the students. 

The chapter agenda will be in parallel with our already established series of talks. So far, we have two lecture series of a slightly different purpose running:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{tea talks:} A bi-weekly meeting where PhD students and staff members present their current research,
 \item \textit{project baNaNa:} A list of lectures by and for PhD students about scientific software and computer tools, cf. \href{http://projectbanana.github.io/}{http://projectbanana.github.io/}.
\end{itemize}
However, both projects are at the moment limited to the Numerical Analysis group and independent of each other. The framework of a SIAM student chapter would help us to connect both lecture series and include other faculty members. Moreover, the financial support of SIAM would allow us to invite guest speakers once or twice a year.

We plan to have monthly chapter meetings and events. Typical chapter activities would include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Setting up a TU Delft student chapter Web site.
\item Scientific talks in Numerical Linear Algebra and CFD
\item Coding in \textsc{Python} sessions.
\newpage
\item Version control with \textsc{git} and \textsc{github}.
\item \LaTeX \ tips and tricks sessions - an introduction to technical writing with \LaTeX.
\item Annual BBQ at Delft lake.
\item Participate in student day and poster session at SIAM Annual Meeting.
\item Establish SIAM lounge to facilitate student interaction and collaboration.
\item Organize talks by students or faculty.
\item Sponsor lectures by guest speakers.
\end{enumerate}

Sponsor and faculty advisors are listed as the following.
